Overall todo:
-[x] Full first-stage fits
-[x] Rerun inversion
-[x] Implement OSSE
-[x] Unfix SIF
-[x] Fix resp linear in certain regions?

-[x] run LNLGIS inversion with resp free
-[x] plot fluxes for individual transcoms to see whether any are especially large
-[x] create new alpha by changing the assim and resp linear components by about 20%, constrained so that NEE will be the same
-[x] plot boxplots for metrics over regions and then months


Plots to make for each set of samples

[x]Trace plots
* Could include ESS in the title
- all tau, rho, kappa, and gamma parameters
- alpha for intercept and slope in all regions
- different harmonics at different regions
- residuals in a handful of locations, and a uniform sample across the 79 months
  - also include ocean component here (it's fixed everywhere else)

Findings:
- decent mixing even with only 100 samples
- rho parameter for SIF is very small (massive inflation); any change after first-stage fitted?


[x] Coefficient estimates
- plot estimates for trend and seasonality components; put basis-vector ID on the y-axis and dots on the y axis; one dot for each method, and maybe intervals too
- for the residual component, try monthly global maps of differences between LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF (actually, maps of the coefficients are very helpful)

Findings:
- SIF observations alone can move the GPP estimates, but don't move the respiration estimates much
- there is some difference between estimates for, say, LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF, but estimates are very similar for GPP intercept and trend


[x] SIF residuals


[x] Time series
- global total flux per year
- global total flux per month
- same as above, but for GPP, respiration, and NEE
- monthly decomposition of GPP, respiration, and NEE

Findings:
- global totals agree
- addition of the SIF data doesn't change the posterior means, though for the GPP and respiration components, including SIF does narrow the credible interval
- for global monthly, including SIF shifts the respiration cycle, but strangely NEE cycle isn't effected
- including SIF increases the amplitude of GPP and respiration cycles

[x] Maps
* differences between LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF
** also, how can we map adjustments to uncertainty?
- difference maps of total fluxes
- difference maps for GPP intercept and trend


[x] Mike's analyses
- some changes in zonal amplitude and phase shifts
- some changes to spatial patterns of phase shifts, esp. for respiration



Original hard-coded parameters for SIF:
# data.frame(
#   hyperparameter_group = '3_SIF',
#   rho = 0.8,
#   ell = 0.75,
#   gamma = 0.6,
#   ell_unit = 'mins'
# )


OSSE Todo:
-[x] Fix ALPHA0 case?
  - Very large precision parameters for trend/seasonality component; numerical instability with essentially zero variance?
-[x] General plots for OSSE samples (with comparisions)
-[x] RMSE and CRPS (one table each): OSSE cases in rows and fluxes in columns (total, gpp, resp, etc)


Results to include:
- discuss ability to unfix the resp linear component as a minor extension of v2
- maps of total number of obs by grid cell for each obs type (IS, LNLG, and SIF); time series of observations by month for each type
  - also see Bryne 2023 Fig 3

OSSE:
- metrics table
- metrics by month and region for ALPHAFREE (others in supplement)
- QQ plots to comparing the true quantiles to the estimated ones?

Real-data:
With resp. linear free in all cases...
- monthly posterior fluxes with and without SIF (global and regional)
  - average seasonal cycle across all years for GPP and resp.; any changes with SIF?
  - can difference with and without SIF be shown to be significant? (eg Shiga et al 2018, Fig 3)
- map changes in average GPP and resp.; without SIF - with SIF (see Fig 3 in Bryne et al 2018 for good comparison with diff)
  - maybe also map average of residuals during el nino period; without SIF vs with SIF
  - map average GPP and resp. by season (average over all years)?
- percent uncertainty reduction with SIF (map, latitudes, time, etc.)
- emissions during el nino 2015/2016?
- Bayesian learning? posterior - prior vs (prior, time, latitude)
  - map of average annual difference (eg Fig 1, Macbean et al 2018)
- fitted and residual SIF?; time series and maps
- Parameter values and distributions? Similar length-scales for OCO-2 XCO2 and SIF


Is there some special feature we can find when SIF is included?
