Plots to make for each set of samples

[x]Trace plots
* Could include ESS in the title
- all tau, rho, kappa, and gamma parameters
- alpha for intercept and slope in all regions
- different harmonics at different regions
- residuals in a handful of locations, and a uniform sample across the 79 months
  - also include ocean component here (it's fixed everywhere else)


[] Coefficient estimates
- plot estimates for trend and seasonality components; put basis-vector ID on the y-axis and dots on the y axis; one dot for each method, and maybe intervals too
- for the residual component, try monthly global maps of differences between LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF

[] SIF residuals


[] Time series
- global total flux per year
- global total flux per month
- same as above, but for GPP, respiration, and NEE
- monthly decomposition of GPP, respiration, and NEE

[] Maps
* differences between LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF
** also, how can we map adjustments to uncertainty?
- difference maps of total fluxes
- difference maps for GPP intercept and trend
