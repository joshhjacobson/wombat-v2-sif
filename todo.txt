Overall todo:
-[x] Full first-stage fits
-[x] Rerun inversion
-[x] Implement OSSE
-[] Unfix SIF
-[] Include SIF outliers?


Plots to make for each set of samples

[x]Trace plots
* Could include ESS in the title
- all tau, rho, kappa, and gamma parameters
- alpha for intercept and slope in all regions
- different harmonics at different regions
- residuals in a handful of locations, and a uniform sample across the 79 months
  - also include ocean component here (it's fixed everywhere else)

Findings:
- decent mixing even with only 100 samples
- rho parameter for SIF is very small (massive inflation); any change after first-stage fitted?


[x] Coefficient estimates
- plot estimates for trend and seasonality components; put basis-vector ID on the y-axis and dots on the y axis; one dot for each method, and maybe intervals too
- for the residual component, try monthly global maps of differences between LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF (actually, maps of the coefficients are very helpful)

Findings:
- SIF observations alone can move the GPP estimates, but don't move the respiration estimates much
- there is some difference between estimates for, say, LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF, but estimates are very similar for GPP intercept and trend


[x] SIF residuals


[x] Time series
- global total flux per year
- global total flux per month
- same as above, but for GPP, respiration, and NEE
- monthly decomposition of GPP, respiration, and NEE

Findings:
- global totals agree
- addition of the SIF data doesn't change the posterior means, though for the GPP and respiration components, including SIF does narrow the credible interval
- for global monthly, including SIF shifts the respiration cycle, but strangely NEE cycle isn't effected
- including SIF increases the amplitude of GPP and respiration cycles

[x] Maps
* differences between LNLGIS and LNLGISSIF
** also, how can we map adjustments to uncertainty?
- difference maps of total fluxes
- difference maps for GPP intercept and trend


[x] Mike's analyses
- some changes in zonal amplitude and phase shifts
- some changes to spatial patterns of phase shifts, esp. for respiration



Original hard-coded parameters for SIF:
# data.frame(
#   hyperparameter_group = '3_SIF',
#   rho = 0.8,
#   ell = 0.75,
#   gamma = 0.6,
#   ell_unit = 'mins'
# )


OSSE Todo:
-[] Fix ALPHA0 case?
  - Very large precision parameters for trend/seasonality component; numerical instability with essentially zero variance?
-[x] General plots for OSSE samples (with comparisions)
-[x] RMSE and CRPS (one table each): OSSE cases in rows and fluxes in columns (total, gpp, resp, etc)
